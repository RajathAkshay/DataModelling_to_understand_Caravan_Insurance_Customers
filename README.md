# DataModelling_to_understand_Caravan_Insurance_Customers
Introduction Nowadays, data is everywhere and in large scale. However, data is of no use if there is no one to analyse and extract knowledge from it. This assessment focuses on extracting knowledge from the car insurance data. Assume that you are a data analyst hired by a car insurance company, your task is to analyse the customer data collected by the car insurance company and use the knowl- edge from your analysis to help the company implement a targeted marketing strategy. In this assessment, you are going to analyse a car insurance data set, which is based on real world business data. The problem you are going to solve is: Can you • predict who would be interested in buying a caravan insurance policy? • explain why you make such a prediction? Describe the actual or potential customers; and explain why these customers buy a caravan policy.
